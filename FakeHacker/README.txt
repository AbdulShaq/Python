Welcome to the Fake Hacker program! Use this to trick your friends to think you know how to hack or for an actor to pretend
to hack for a show!

How to use:
   
    Find the fake code you want to use in any language and put it in a text file. examples are included for testing in python,
Java, and C++.

the in the terminal you would enter in for example:  C:...\> python FakeHacker.py PythonCode.txt
                                                     or
                                                     C:...\> python FakeHacker.py JavaCode.txt

the program will read every character and space you put in the text file and then wait on the user to press any key and it will
print the next character or space from the text file regardless of what keys you press.
example:
      button pressed: 4
      program output: d
      
      button pressed: 4;rljgk;legj;lgetghwhw
      program output: def FakeHacker(string)

Once you have reached the end of the text file content "===ACCESS GRANTED===" will print out on the screen in green. if you
press any button after that it will display "===ACCESS GRANTED===" again. After the 3rd time of this happening the program will
exit.

Have fun tricking who ever you like!!!
