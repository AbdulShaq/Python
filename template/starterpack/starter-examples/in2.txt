Blank
lines
mark
paragraph
boundaries.
Otherwise, consecutive non-blank lines are put together in a single paragraph.


Blank lines at the beginning of the file
should not result in an empty paragraph.
Similarly, many blank lines between paragraphs
should be treated in the same way as a single
blank line.





The file need not end in a blank line.
