Examples of template.py input and output
----------------------------------------

This directory contains examples of variable files, input files, and
output files for a program that meets the Project 3 specifications.

In this directory, there are three examples.  The files for example N
are called:

* varsN.dat - variable file for example N
* inN.template - input file for example N
* outN.html - expected output for example N

Here N is 1, 2, or 3.

To test your program, you should use it with the given variable and
input files, and then compare the output to the expected output.  For
example, if your program template.py is in the parent directory, the
command might be:

python ..\template.py vars1.dat in1.template test1.html

which will write output to test1.html.  This file should be compared
to the expected output in out1.html in this directory.

Note that the output will not necessarily match until you have
completed the project!
